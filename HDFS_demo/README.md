# HDFS Demo with Java Applications

This repository demonstrates how to interact with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) using Java applications. The project includes:
- **App1**: Reads a file from HDFS
- **AppWriter**: Writes data to a file in HDFS
- **Docker-Compose Setup**: Deploys an HDFS cluster with a NameNode and multiple DataNodes

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+
- Apache Hadoop JARs (included in `./jars` directory)
- Git (optional, for cloning this repository)

---

## 1. Setting up the HDFS Cluster

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

### Step 2: Start the HDFS Cluster (cd HDFSCuster)
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This command launches:
- A **NameNode** (managing file system metadata)
- Five **DataNodes** (storing file blocks)
- A **ResourceManager** (for YARN jobs)
- A **NodeManager** (for managing containerized applications)

### Step 3: Verify the Cluster Status
Check if all services are running:
```sh
docker ps
```
Access the HDFS web UI: [http://localhost:9870](http://localhost:9870)

## 2. Interacting with HDFS

### Creating Directories and Files
```sh
# Create a new directory in HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop

# Create an empty file
hdfs dfs -touchz /file.txt
```

### Uploading a File
```sh
hdfs dfs -put localfile.txt /file.txt
```

### Listing Files
```sh
hdfs dfs -ls /
```

### Reading a File
```sh
hdfs dfs -cat /file.txt
```

---

## 3. Running the Java Applications

### Step 1: Compile the Java Code
Ensure your Hadoop JARs are available in the classpath.
```sh
javac -cp "./jars/*" -d . src/org/example/tpHDFS/App1.java
javac -cp "./jars/*" -d . src/org/example/tpHDFS/AppWriter.java
```

### Step 2: Run the Writer Application
This will create a new file (`file2.txt`) in HDFS and write data into it.
```sh
java -cp "./jars/*:." org.example.tpHDFS.AppWriter
```
Verify the file content:
```sh
hdfs dfs -cat /file2.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Reader Application
This will read and print the content of `/file.txt`.
```sh
java -cp "./jars/*:." org.example.tpHDFS.App1
```

---

## 4. Stopping the Cluster
```sh
docker-compose down
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting
- **Check Hadoop Logs**
  ```sh
  docker logs namenode
  ```
- **Check Running Containers**
  ```sh
docker ps
  ```
- **Restart a Container**
  ```sh
docker restart namenode
  ```
